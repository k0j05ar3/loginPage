# Demo Login Page

## Description
This is a demo login page that was made to practice designing a webpage for different screen sizes before implementing it into code and added responsiveness to the site to make it more accessible on many different devices. This project should include some functionality to operate similar to most login pages that we see almost everyday.

Users, or visitors, should be able to do the following:
- Submit the username and password to enter the site
- Receive an error message when submitting the wrong password
- Use the forgot username and forgot password links
- Access the locked away page

## Access
You can access the login page and try it out for yourself at the following link: [Demo Login Page](https://k0j05ar3.github.io/loginPage)

## Contributions
I used some tutorials from [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com/) to create the site the way that it is.

## License
No licenses were added.
